# How to Build a Python Zonal Statistics Tool
A Jupyter Notebook with supporting files documenting the creation of a GUI-driven raster analysis tool for calculating zonal statistics. Please click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ui-libraries/Zonal_Statistics_Tool_JupyterNotebook/blob/main/ZonalStatistics.ipynb) for a downloadable version of the notebook.

NOTE: While I have included a Binder link below, the Tkinter GUI scripts will not work when run exlusively through Binder.
