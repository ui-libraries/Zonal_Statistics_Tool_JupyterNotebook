# GIS-Free: How to Build an Open-Source Zonal Statistics Tool without GIS
A Jupyter Notebook with supporting files documenting the creation of a raster analysis tool for calculating zonal statistics. This tool runs on Python with support from gdal, rasterio, and rasterstats for shapefile and raster processing, and ipywidgets and ipyfilechooser for handling user inputs. Please click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ui-libraries/Zonal_Statistics_Tool_JupyterNotebook/blob/main/ZonalStatistics_withWidgets.ipynb) for a downloadable version of the notebook. 

Dependencies:
- gdal
- rasterio
- rasterstats
- ipywidgets
- ipyfilechooser

All analysis can be performed within Jupyter Notebook. You do not need to download or use any GIS software. Please click the Binder link below for a fully-implementable walkthrough.
